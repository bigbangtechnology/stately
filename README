Use Cases:

I'll get to that.

Example:

Check out the tests for some example usage. You mix Stately into Backbone Views like this:

var MyView = Backbone.View.extend(Stately).extend({
  transitions: {
    state_a: {

    },

    state_b: {
    	// states do not need to define any transitions
    },
    
    state_c: {
      before_transition: function() {
      	// before transition
      },
      
      after_transition: function() {
      	// after transition 
      }
    }
  },
  
  getState: function() {
    return this.nextState;
  },
  
  // example, in practice you'd probably want to listen
  // for changes in your model and update your state based
  // on that
  setState: function(state) {
    this.nextState = state;
    
    this.revalidateState(function() {
	// during transition
    });
  }
});

var view = new MyView({ model: Backbone.Model() });

view.setState("state_c");
